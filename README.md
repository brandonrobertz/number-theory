# Number Theory Stuff

Welcome to my collected notes, notebooks and code related to number theory.

Much of this follows from the textbook [Number Theory: In Context and Interactive](https://www.math.gordon.edu/ntic/). The notebooks are [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) notebooks (but can be viewed as normal Python notebooks).

The Prolog script `number_theory.pl` assumes [Scryer Prolog](https://www.scryer.pl). It has various facts, rules and definitions both from NTIC and independent number theory study.
